## Project Overview
In this project, I have analyzed marketing performance across different channels using **Google BigQuery** and **Looker Studio** to optimize ad spend and improve conversion rates.

### Problem Statement
Marketing teams often struggle with budget allocation across multiple channels. This analysis addresses key questions such as:
- Which marketing channels generate the highest conversions?
- What is the **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)** for each campaign?
- How does marketing spend impact conversion trends over time?

## Approach & Metrics
I adopted a structured approach, leveraging **BigQuery (SQL) for data processing** and **Looker Studio for interactive visualizations**, focusing on key performance metrics:

âœ” **Total Spend, Conversions & CPA Breakdown**  
âœ” **Conversion Trends Over Time**  
âœ” **Marketing Channel Performance** (Social, Paid Search, Referral, Email, Organic)

## Key Insights
- **Most cost-effective channel:** Social Media (**CPA â‚¹4.27**)
- **Highest conversion rate:** Paid Search (**34.83%**)
- **Most expensive channel:** Email (**CPA â‚¹12.58**)
- **Drop in spend during December impacted conversions**
